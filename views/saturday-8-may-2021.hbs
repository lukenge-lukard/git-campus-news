                    <span style="float: left;  font-size: 500%; line-height: 90%;">J</span>oining in on the week with
                    smiles and energy from last week’s Saturday, this week’s Sunday, 2nd May, 2021 saw the Freshers face
                    off with the giants from the ongoing students in the different sports activities that were arranged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fair and square as the games were, the freshers didn’t really stand any chance of even tasting
                    victory in any endeavor. Not at the anger and affinity for the games that had accumulated throughout
                    the period that the ongoing students were home not touching any ball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From engaging in games like chess, football and volleyball; the freshers were them seen matching to
                    the ceremonial grounds where they swore allegiance to the university throughout their stay in its
                    structures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes, they were oriented; but this was initiation! Well, from there, the rest was history. The food,
                    the dance, the fun, generally, it was the freshers’ ball. Our cameras weren’t given the chance to
                    peep through to see “anti-social” zero distance dancing but yeah, the year ones definitely enjoyed
                    their day.

                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">INNOVATION WORKSHOP</h5>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="images/innov1.jpg" alt="image" style="">
                <p>
                    Blowing past Monday, Tuesday, the 4th of May, 2021 was a very significant one for the innovative
                    community of Lira University as it was the blessed day that housed the Innovations Workshop that
                    took place at Gracious Palace Hotel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Workshop brought in all the necessary authorities to avail to the student innovators the new
                    ways of doing things. Authorities like our very own, the Deputy Vice Chancellor Academic Affairs,
                    Prof. Okaka Opio Dokotum (PhD) who was the Chairman for the entire discussion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the room were also librarian authorities that included, Mr. Ojulong Andrew, the Ag. University
                    Librarian; Mr. Izaruku Ronald (Librarian I), Mr. Isaac Mukungu (Librarian II) and Ms. Ajwang Lydia
                    (Library Assistant I).
                </p>
                <p>
                    These were very elaborate as they explained to the attendees the workings of the Innovations Hub, a
                    portal for the student innovators to send in their ideas and innovations, registered and patented
                    through the very portal to stand a chance to obtain funding from the Erasmus+ European Union Program
                    under the AHEAD project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was this very day that the DVC first announced his interest in organizing for a magazine project.
                    Campus Weekly was honored to be in attendance of the entire session and is therefore glad to mention
                    with confidence that when it comes to student innovators, the administration has you all covered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All you have to do is come up; with your ideas, prototypes and how you want the administration to
                    help you push further.
                </p>
                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">INTERNATIONAL DAY OF THE MIDWIFE </h5>


                <img class="img-fluid" src="images/midwifeday.jpg" alt="image" style="">
                <p>
                    5th May, this week’s Wednesday was the International Midwives’ day. If you are any friends with
                    midwifery students at the university, you would know by now that the day really didn’t meet any of
                    the anticipation it was assigned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The students actually had normal lectures! That seems normal to anyone else but not to the midwives
                    who felt that some special package would be organized on their day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Busy as days can get, Friday was surely the busiest of this week. Housing items like the first
                    magazine committee meeting that spanned from 10:00 am to 2:00pm, field trips for the year three
                    entrepreneurship students, and field work for the year three psychology students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entrepreneurship students were a joint group that included computer scientist and members from
                    the business courses, all finalists. Their field trip was quite an educational one as they visited
                    the Lira Industrial Centre discussing and learning from the entrepreneurs in the area about how they
                    made their business, the start ups and the challenges they faced throughout to this day.

                    The weekend was painted with beauty as the students of Sexual Reproductive Health And Rights, a
