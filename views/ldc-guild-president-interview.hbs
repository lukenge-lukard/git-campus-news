                <p>
                    Just as promised, our cameras already at work, just couldn’t decide on which story to cover this
                    week and which one to leave. Shuffling through the collection of stories around campus, I landed on
                    the interview I had with the Guild President of the newly established Lira LDC community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having any doubts on whether leadership and good looks have any intersection whatsoever? I’m quite
                    sure you just haven’t met H. E Rutebemberwa Smith! The cutest man from the land of Ankole currently
                    residing over a team of eight Guild officials leading an entire intake of close to three hundred and
                    fifteen 2020/2021 lawyers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Law Development Centre opening its third branch at Lira Campus, the first and second being
                    Kampala Main Branch and Mbarara, brings with it a new feel and style to the air the campus has been
                    used to. Yes, the full time high standard taste in attire is not an attribute shared only by Mr.
                    Smith. No, my friend, the university just got itself three hundred and fifteen recruits pulling off
                    a completely new swag for the campus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You definitely shouldn’t be alarmed finding the year one freshers being overly respectful, it is
                    terribly no fault of their own! Seeing some of these fine ladies and gentlemen in their suits, you
                    quickly compare them with our very own – the lecturers, some of whom can’t really pull it off – that
                    kind of executive-ness. These gentlemen looking more of lecturers than our own lecturers, is really
                    an understatement.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>
                    Already qualified lawyers, here for their fifth and possibly their final year allowing them become
                    advocates – representing clients in the courts of law. With the four years of their theoretical
                    understanding of the law, this year encompasses all the practice there is, necessary to make one
                    capable of pulling off those stunts we watch in movies with actors taking on the good lawyer role,
                    pulling off very compelling arguments for their clients in front of the judge and the jury.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When tempted to comment on whether the nice suits and the hot and not exactly executive environment
                    the campus already sits on, presented any thoughts of swag loss, His Excellence, the president
                    treaded the waters quite smoothly. Citing that the attire really isn’t for the swag adventures that
                    come with it, rather it is a requirement that comes with the legal profession. One that
                    interestingly has super restrictions when it comes to colors, allowing only for variations of black
                    or navy-blue suits and definitely none of the shouting colors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From an entirely different angle, I muscled through to another area of discussion. You know how
                    every course has about three to four years of study, that is to say; year one students, year two
                    students, in that order, but all studying the same course, taking for instance BSc. Public Health.
                    Our post graduate friends in the LDC division will only have one year of students every year per
                    intake. And instead of having a class coordinator because of it being one class, they will each year
                    elect their own Guild President, an interesting idea that obviously couldn’t miss discussing during
                    our interview.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With no way of going around it in my opinion, the president explained it with quite some ease!
                    “There had to be a leadership structure to handle concerns specific to the lawyers.” Which statement
                    obviously suggested that the current University Guild President was definitely not the man for the
                    job, clearly justifying the need for a separate Guild!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having made it clear that his Presidency is in line with concerns, academic or otherwise, of the
                    team of lawyers in his regime, presented to and handled by the administration, Mr. Smith still let
                    us in on a secret advantage that the university and the native community around the campus might
                    just take pride in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We are ready and willing to offer any and all legal advice to the campus or the natives when they
                    approach us. And where need be, at very low costs,” the president responded when asked whether the
                    LDC Guild has anything in stock for the university as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, it would be now that I come out and apologize to our female readers for having Mr. Smith’s
                    phone contacts left out in this article. In my defense though; I stand restricted by our privacy
                    policy, not to release any personal contacts or physical address without the consent of the
                    personnel we interview.
                </p>
