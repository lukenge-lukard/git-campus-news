                    <span style="float: left;  font-size: 500%; line-height: 90%;">“</span>Life is hard. Life has become
                    hard one of these days. The world has become too small for me.” These are some of the wordings that
                    fill both teenage and adult conversations most if not all the time. But has it ever occurred to you
                    to get deep down into the heart of the matter?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tell you; you will discover nothing more or less than the subject of money. It's so unfortunate
                    that we live in a world where money has been tainted black! "My daughter loves money so much, I fear
                    she might get spoilt," said your loving and caring mom. In most societies, children's interaction
                    with money is limited, because of the negative attitudes associated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This leads us to a question; of which, concern was raised by Robert Kiyosaki in his book "Rich dad
                    poor dad". Between the love of money and the lack of it, which one is the root of all evils? A very
                    good question; one you can answer in your own way!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm sure everyone has the desire to succeed financially or at least, to be in position to meet ends
                    and emergency without difficult. And yet most of us ignore the subject of money with others going as
                    far as considering it bad!
                </p>
                <p>
                    A security guard stays in the cold all through the night to see the month’s pay. A doctor keeps up
                    at work to fatten his pocket at the month's end. A man will stay at work away from his wife and
                    children; far away from home, to secure an income to keep the family running.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At campus here, we have a lot of students pursuing courses not of their interest simply because
                    Uncle Peter said jobs related to such a course pay very highly. This therefore means that money
                    surely plays an iconic role in our day-to-day sessions of decision making and interactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Money therefore becomes an element that we must learn how best to interact with.
                </p>
                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">MONEY VS HAPPINESS</h5>
                <p>
                    Not all rich people are happy and just as well; not all poor people are happy. There are other
                    factors in life; those that money can't buy! Take for instance; self-discipline, love, trust. These
                    life factors can't be quantified in terms of money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I do believe that; watching your mum die at home, simply because you couldn’t afford the
                    hospital bills, has some serious pain attached to it! Watching your daughter dropping out of school
                    also because you don't have the money to pay her tuition won't make you any happy!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>
                    The landlord's knocking will not make you smile. I'm not saying money brings happiness; I'm saying,
                    the lack of it, may bring unhappiness or real evil! (covered in "The creation of a prostitute", an
                    essay to be soon loaded on The Campus Weekly)

                <p>
                    Let's save the aspect of money vs freedom for another day.

                    What can one do then...
                </h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Get yourself financially educated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Learn the habit of saving and investing as early as possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Read self-help books such as Napoleon Hills series, Robert Kiyosaki’s Rich dad series and BMK's
                        biography that was launched recently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Acknowledge that income generation is not an automatic process but rather an active process that
                        involves you making decisions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Above all, let's change our mental set up about the subject of money. There are good things
                        money can do for us, and as yes; just like any other element, it can be used negatively.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                    It's a privilege to exist in Africa in this generation, where vast opportunities lie in the process
                    of developing Africa to reach the level of first world countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do believe that God has already blessed us with the gift of life, it's upon us to bless ourselves
                    with the gift of a good one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is what I believe. This is my opinion. if the coverage interested you, let's raise a glass to
                    Bill Gates who said, "If you’re born poor it’s not your mistake, but if you die poor it’s your
                    mistake!"
